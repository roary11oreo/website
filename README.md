# Rory Jones's personal website

This is the repo for my personal website, [rorycjones.com](rorycjones.com). It is built using the Academic theme for Hugo and deployed via Netlify. Any commit to the master branch kicks off a deploy of the live site via Netlify's CDN.

I mostly like to edit this website using Gitpod -- the button at the top will launch a development environment complete with local deployment of the site for testing changes.
